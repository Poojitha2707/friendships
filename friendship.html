                Bhavanaaaaaa 💛,
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve carried these words quietly for a long time, and today I finally decided to write them.</p>
                
            <p> Even without many conversations or shared seats in class, you somehow became important to me.
                i don't know exactly how or when it happened - it just did.
                Sometimes a person becomes special not because of moments spent together,
                but because of the way they make the world feel a little lighter.
            </p>

            <p>There were days I wished we talked more, days i hoped for even a small smile or hello.
            Not because I expected anything, but because I genuinely cared and felt a connection I couldn't explain
            </p>
            <p>
                You may never realize this, but your presence touched my heart in a very quiet way.
                Just seeing you smile, or simply exist the way you do gave me comfort on days when i needed it the most.
                Without knowing it , you became someone I cared about deeply.
            </p>

            <p>This message is not asking for anything in return, and it doesn't carry expectations. It's simply the
            truth of a friendship I felt silently - pure, genuine, and fulled with warmth.
            Some feeling don't need to be spoken often to be real , they live quietly and honestly in the heart.</p>
            <p>
                I just want you to know that the care I feel for you is real and heartfelt. It may be quiet and unspoken,
                but it comes from a place of genuine love and admiration for who you are. I don't expect anything
                in return - this is simply me being honest about my feelings. No matter where life takes us, my
                heart will always wish the best for you, with love and respect.

            </p>
            
            <p>Holding you tightly in my heart,</p>
            <p>your Friend </p>
            <p>Poojitha 💛</p>
